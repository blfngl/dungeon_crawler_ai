Project One - Problem Formulation

1) States

All valid configurations of the dungeon: rooms, dragon location, sword location, agent location, etc.

2) Actions

Move to a new room.

3) Transition model

State(Location, Move(Direction)) => State(New Location)

4) Goal test

a) Does the agent have the sword?
b) Has the agent defeated the dragon?
c) Did the dragon drop the key?
d) Has the agent located and moved to the exit?

If all have been completed, the agent has reached its goal.

5) Path cost

Each room traversal: +1.
